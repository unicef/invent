</div>

<p><translate>The MAPS Toolkit provides <b>actionable information</b> that will help project teams to consider and address diverse concerns relating to scaling up and sustaining their mHealth product. The Toolkit has two overarching goals:</translate></p>

<ul>
  <li><translate><b>Assess:</b> MAPS helps project teams to critically evaluate the progress of scaling up their mHealth product through a detailed set of self-assessment questions (SAQs). Scoring their answers will allow project teams to measure and track their position along the pathway of scale.</translate></li>
  <li><translate><b>Plan:</b> The outcomes of the self-assessment process will help project teams to define their priorities and plan their next steps. In addition, the Toolkit offers separate planning and guidance features that will help devise strategies to address and overcome the challenges inherent in scaling up.</translate></li>
</ul>

<p><translate>The self-assessment and planning components together will advance the progress of project teams. Since scaling up is an ongoing process, teams are encouraged to use the Toolkit at multiple time points. MAPS guides projects through an <b>iterative cyclical process</b> of thorough assessment, careful planning and targeted improvements. These steps will facilitate the successful scaling up of mHealth products and help to establish a foundation for sustainability (see Figure 1).</translate></p>

<h4><translate>What are the axes of scale?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>MAPS provides a structure for organizing the specific activities and considerations that will determine a successful journey through the process of scaling up. The key determinants or axes of scale are <b>Groundwork</b>, <b>Partnerships</b>, <b>Financial health</b>, <b>Technology &amp; architecture</b>, <b>Operations</b>, and <b>Monitoring &amp; evaluation</b> (see Figure 2). These areas are considered to be relevant to all projects that have the goals of increasing scale and ensuring sustainability.</translate></p>

</div>

<p><translate>Each axis is divided into <b>domains</b>, which capture the specific drivers of increasing scale. The domains comprise various <b>factors</b>, which represent the specific criteria used for the purpose of self-assessment (see Figure 3).</translate></p>

<h4><translate>How was maps developed?</translate></h4>

<blockquote>
    <h6><translate>IWG Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism</translate></h6>
    <p><translate>The IWG Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism is a UNF–WHO collaboration funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), and is part of the UN Secretary General’s Every Woman Every Child initiative. This grant mechanism has served as a strategic investment for accelerating mHealth innovations that focus on strengthening health systems in developing countries in order to improve RMNCH. Between 2011 and 2015, the programme supported the scaling up of 26 mHealth projects by providing funding, technical assistance and joint learning opportunities.</translate></p>
</blockquote>

<p><translate>Development of the MAPS Toolkit was initiated within the context of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Foundation (UNF)-led Innovation Working Group (IWG) Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism initiative, which provides financial, technical and joint learning support to RMNCH projects. The team developed MAPS over several years, engaging with numerous mHealth projects and drawing on the experience of experts in the mHealth, implementation science, and maternal and child health fields. Additionally, Toolkit authors facilitated technical workshops and conducted field research at country level, using key informant interviews to explore and understand the different factors affecting the scaling up and sustainability of projects. The network of IWG mHealth project grantees played a fundamental role in informing and validating the Toolkit throughout its development.</translate></p>

<p><translate>The development of MAPS included:</translate></p>

<ul>
  <li><translate>joint learning and technical assistance workshops with IWG grantee mHealth projects and technical experts;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>literature review;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>site visits and interviews with mHealth projects and key partners;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>consultations with technical experts in the areas of mHealth, health information systems, health policy, implementation research, health financing, health systems and RMNCH;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>review panel;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>pre-testing.</translate></li>
</ul>

<translate>Additional information regarding the development of the Toolkit is provided in Annex 1.</translate>

<h4><translate>What does the toolkit contain?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>The Toolkit has six chapters pertaining to the axes of scale. Each chapter is divided into three sections to meet the assessment and planning needs of projects.</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>A. Thematic overview:</b> This section provides definitions and descriptions of key concepts, and highlights their relevance to scaling up and sustainability. It also includes diagrams to illustrate the conceptual framework underlying the Toolkit.</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>B. Self-assessment:</b> This section presents a series of SAQs, which represent a set of tangible indicators based on the concepts outlined in the thematic overview.</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>C. Planning and guidance:</b> The final section in each chapter builds on the SAQs by offering examples and resources to help project teams plan their future efforts and undertake corrective actions. These are highlighted using three features:</translate></p>

<ol>
  <li><translate><b>Tips and considerations:</b> Harnesses the collective experiences of projects vetted through the IWG mHealth catalytic programme and implementers in the field to offer suggestions and considerations.</translate></li>

  <li><translate><b>Lessons from the field:</b> Specific examples demonstrating how different implementers have approached and addressed some of the major challenges to scaling up. This includes experiences from a variety of projects (see Annex 2 for brief descriptions of the projects).</translate></li>

  <li><translate><b>Resources:</b> Provides links to relevant websites, reports and other tools that project teams may find useful.</translate></li>
</ol>

<h4><translate>Who is maps for?</translate></h4>

<blockquote>
    <h6><translate>mHEALTH STRATEGY</translate></h6>
    <p><translate>The application of a technology for a defined health purpose (e.g. text message to deliver messages for antenatal care follow-up) in order to address specific health system challenges.</translate></p>
</blockquote>

<p><translate>MAPS was designed specifically for managers and/or project teams that are already deploying an mHealth product and aiming to increase its impact through scaling up; the mHealth product has already undergone an initial proof-of-concept or has been “successfully tested”. The Toolkit is not intended for organizations that are in the early stages of designing an mHealth product, although certain pieces of information may prove useful for such teams.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Projects using MAPS should meet the following basic criteria:</translate></p>

<ul>
  <li><translate>The project uses software and hardware technologies developed in-house, or as provided by an external company, for the purposes of improving health.</translate></li>
  <li><translate>The mHealth project can describe the use of the technology as an <b>mHealth strategy</b>.</translate></li>
  <li><translate>The project team has plans to increase scale by using the endgames discussed above, i.e. government adoption, commercial adoption or a hybrid model.</translate></li>
</ul>
