  <p><translate>Sustainable financing is fundamental to the capacity of an mHealth project to increase its scale, yet it is often the most difficult part of the process. The considerations and skills involved in developing sustainable financing mechanisms are complex, and require project team members with robust financial skill sets to plan for and execute viable financial models. When thinking through financial health, project teams should first begin with a thorough assessment of the diverse types of costs associated with scaling up, especially those that are not readily observable. In addition, project teams must create a business model that adds value to all stakeholders, and attracts reliable financing streams to sustain project activities.</translate></p>
