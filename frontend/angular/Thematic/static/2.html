  <p><translate>Strong, sustainable partnerships are essential for successfully scaling up an mHealth product, and for determining its capacity to make lasting improvements in the health system. Since mHealth represents the intersection of the health, technology and business sectors, increasing its scale will involve a wide range of external groups. Successful partnerships will bring together diverse skills, services, strategies, lessons learnt, audiences and ideas; all with a common goal in mind.23 However, the process of achieving and maintaining dedicated, productive collaborations is no easy task. Strategic decision-making is required at many stages throughout the partnership’s development to avoid the fault lines that threaten a project’s trajectory.</translate></p>
