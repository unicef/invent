<p><translate>Project leaders and staff also need appropriate training, supervision and support. <b><em>User training</em></b>, which involves end-users and secondary users, must be tailored specifically to the needs and levels of experience of the participants. It is widely recognized that effective engagement with health workers and other end-users is the key to successful adoption of mHealth products. Training programmes should also aim to foster a sense of perceived value of the product among end-users. The scaling-up process will be hampered if health workers fail to see the benefits of the application on their workload, or if they feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the technology.</translate></p>

<p><translate>End-users’ adoption of the product will also be influenced by the availability and quality of routine <b><em>supervision</em></b> for monitoring their activities and addressing any concerns or confusion that may emerge. Effective supervision needs an organizational structure and human resource management to oversee work in the field. This should also be accompanied by the allocation of resources to routine meetings (e.g. to cover the cost of transport and food). In addition, end-users should be trained on the steps to be taken when a question or point of confusion emerges.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Furthermore, <b><em>user and technical support</em></b> systems must be in place for identifying and troubleshooting hardware and software problems during implementation. Project leaders should assemble a technical support team with a strong understanding of user needs and operating constraints based in the local setting. There are many advantages to having a local first-line technical support team: it will minimize costs (compared with paying for external support), create local ownership of the project, and promote sustainability. However, it is also critical to have higher-level support available for technical issues that require greater expertise.</translate></p>
