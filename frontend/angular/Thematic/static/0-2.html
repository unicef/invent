<h4><translate>How do I conduct the self-assessment?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>The mHealth project manager and other relevant members of the project team should use the Toolkit to conduct a process of self-assessment. There are two suggested approaches for completing and responding to the self-assessment questions (SAQs):</translate></p>

<ul>
  <li><translate><b>Individual assessment:</b> Different members of the team complete different sections. While the project manager will probably be able to answer the questions in most areas, certain sections will require input from specialists with a particular skill set within the project; e.g. the financial manager for Axis 3 (Financial health) and the information technology team for Axis 4 (Technology &amp; architecture). Once MAPS has been completed, it is recommended that project managers hold a meeting with the entire team to review the results.</translate></li>
  <li><translate><b>Team assessment:</b> The whole team completes each section in turn. This could involve a series of meetings organized over the course of a month, with the entire team tackling one or two chapters during each meeting.</translate></li>
</ul>

<p><translate>Since every team has different needs, dynamics and organizational structures, project managers should choose the approach that makes most sense to them. Regardless of the route chosen, the self-assessment process will create a space for critical internal reflection, and for team discussions about future course corrections.</translate></p>

<p><translate>The Toolkit should take approximately 1.5–2 hours to complete in its entirety. Determining the next steps needed to address any project shortfalls highlighted by MAPS may be a more extensive process.</translate></p>

<h4><translate>When should I use the toolkit?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>The Toolkit is first and foremost intended to be used as a baseline assessment of where a project stands, and to inform planning for advancement through the scaling-up process. Projects are also strongly encouraged to use the Toolkit periodically after the initial assessment to help the project track its progress, ensure it is on the intended path, and continue to make adjustments throughout its life cycle. During repeated use of the Toolkit, projects may choose to focus on a select number of chapters based on their priority areas.</translate></p>

<h4><translate>How do I respond to the self-assessment questions (SAQs)?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>Each SAQ has a series of sub-statements that capture the particular activities, considerations and procedures reflecting the relevant topic. Each sub-statement is accompanied by a set of response options. Some questions have the basic response options of <b>No</b> and <b>Yes</b>. However, the majority of the SAQs have four response options: <b>No</b>, <b>In progress</b>, <b>Performed</b> and <b>Documented</b>.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Projects should use the guidelines shown in Table 1 to select the most appropriate response for each of the four options. The table includes examples showing how particular project experiences would align with the various response options.</translate></p>

<p><translate>In addition, a small number of questions have the option <b>Not applicable</b> (N/A), which means that the particular item does not apply to a project due to the context or the product. Finally, a few questions have a unique set of response options that are self-explanatory based on the content provided.</translate></p>

<h4><translate>How do I score the toolkit?</translate></h4>

<blockquote>
  <h6><translate>Standard operating procedures (SOPs)</translate></h6>
  <p><translate>Written instructions intended to document the steps required for project staff to perform a particular activity.</translate></p>
</blockquote>

<p><translate>After completing the MAPS Toolkit, you will be able to calculate scores on three levels:</translate></p>

<ol>
  <li><translate>the overall score (total score combining all axes)</translate></li>
  <li><translate>axis scores (a separate score for each of the six axes of scale)</translate></li>
  <li><translate>domain scores (specific scores for the domains within each axis of scale).</translate></li>
</ol>

<p><translate>The scoring mechanisms allow project teams to use quantitative terms to describe their overall progress through the process of scaling up, as well as their internal strengths and weaknesses. The opportunity to compare scores across axes and domains will help project teams determine which areas need further development.</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>Allocation of points:</b> Points are allocated at the level of the sub-statements within each question. Each response option is worth a specific point value, as indicated in the check boxes. For example, No = 0 points, In progress = 1 point, Performed = 2 points, and Documented = 3 points.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Therefore, each question is worth a certain number of points depending on the number of sub-statements accompanying the question. The maximum number of points that can be allocated is indicated beside each question and each domain title (see Figure 4).</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>Scorecards:</b> Six scorecards – one for each axis of scale – are provided to help users calculate their scores. The specific steps entailed in the scoring process are detailed in these scorecards.</translate></p>

<p><translate><b>Final scorecard:</b> Ultimately, the calculations will yield a percentage for each axis of scale as well as for each domain. The final scorecard will allow users to compare scores across the axes of scale and the domains. As the Toolkit is used by more projects, we will gain a greater understanding of the range of scores and their implications. This will eventually allow projects to categorize their progress as they increase their scale, and allow users to compare their scores to other similar projects and to a defined average.</translate></p>

<h4><translate>What should I do with the results?</translate></h4>

<p><translate>The results obtained from the SAQs can be applied in several different ways. First, the axis and domain scores help to shed light on the particular areas that may require additional consideration, activities and strategies from project managers and teams. Projects may consult the tips, lessons from the field, and resources provided in the planning and guidance section of each axis in order to plan efforts to address problem areas. In addition, since the Toolkit can be used periodically, projects can employ it to assess and correct the course of their progress regarding scaling up and the pursuit of their endgame.</translate></p>
